Aim: To help students in studying for school while occupied in transit or other activities such as chores. A college student’s schedule can be specially packed, so it is essential to maximize their study time throughout the day. From traveling in public transportation to eating dinner or doing chores, a large portion of a student’s day goes to waste when it could be better spent studying.

We created an app to address this dilemma by using voice recognition and prompting the user for a quiz on a certain subject of their choosing. This simple yet innovative app comes with preprogrammed tests on Law, Economics, and Physics and can process quizzes of a student’s choosing through a quick insert of a Quizlet link. Our app parses the URL and verbalizes the questions and answers while asking for the student’s input in between. The voice recognition in both the input and output via a Bluetooth device provides a convenient form of studying anywhere and anytime.

Our product not only targets busy college students but is also a perfect fit for auditory learners and anyone who benefits from learning through repetition. It is quick and automatic, and very convenient – it is AutoQuiz.
